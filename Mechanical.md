## Camera Mount Adaptability
  - Design 1: Extendable Camera Mount
    - Motive: Possibility that a camera will not fit
      - Allows a snug fit for any camera
      -	Reduces possibility for camera to rotate on center screw
      -	Required additional sliding mechanisms
      -	Involved too little rigidity in the system
  - Design 2: Freedom of Screw Position & Larger Mount
    - Motive: Not enough options for camera position
      -	Allows fit for all current and future DSLRs
      -	Allows for lateral and longitudinal positioning of camera
      -	Allows for optimal position of center of mass
      -	Possibility of camera rotation (mitigated by tightness 

    #### Design 2 outweighed Design 1

## Slider Mount Tightening
  - Design 1: Spring Loaded Wheel Shaft (4 wheels total)
    - Motive: Consistent Fitment to Rail 
      - Allows for simple setup
      - Requires strong springs in compression
      - Not mechanically reliable
  - Design 2: Eccentric Screw (3 wheels total)
    - Motive: More efficient design solution
      - Uses less wheels
      -	Allows for higher mechanical reliability
      -	Allows for desired tightness using tools
      -	3D printable

## Additional Stepper Motors - Focus & Zoom Control
  - Design 1: Motors attached on the camera mount and adjustable
    - Motive: Fixed on the path of the camera
      -	Allows adjustability of both axes (focus & zoom)
      -	Proximity to lens
      -	Collides with the board and wiring in all optimal camera shots
  - Design 2: Motors attached to the external flash unit of the camera
    - Motive: Fixed on the path of the camera
      -	Allows adjustability of both axes (focus & zoom)
      -	Proximity to lens
      -	Only collides with board if camera is upside-down (unlikely)
      -	Gravity helps prevent any skipping of the gears because they are above the lens
