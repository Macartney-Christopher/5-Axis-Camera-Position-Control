# 5-Axis-Camera-Position-Control
  What I call the "Tasmanian Devil" is a 5-axis camera position control system to get all the video shots you can think of. The entire design is an extension from Isaac879 who did camera rig with three axes, and a shutter control. Using Isaac879's available pinouts and step files, his design was modified to account for focus and zoom control
