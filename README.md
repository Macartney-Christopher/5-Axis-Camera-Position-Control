# 5-Axis-Camera-Position-Control
  The "Tasmanian Devil" is a 5-axis camera position control system to get all the video shots you could dream of. The entire design is an extension from [isaac879](https://github.com/isaac879/Pan-Tilt-Mount)'s camera rig with three axes, and a shutter control. Using Isaac879's available pinouts and step files, his design was modified to account for focus and zoom control.
  Before reading through the rest of the repository it is strongly suggested to look at [isaac879](https://github.com/isaac879/Pan-Tilt-Mount)'s original work on this project.

## Credits
  The mechanical, hardware, and software design is an adapted version of [isaac879](https://github.com/isaac879/Pan-Tilt-Mount)'s project. Isaac879 did a tremendous job with every aspect of the project and shows great skill in his other project as well. [Isaac879's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfB7cLkUyQ) is very well structured and edited.
